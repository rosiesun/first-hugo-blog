# R Markdown

HELLO
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}

dat <- read.csv("~/housing data/housingcost_over30percent.csv")
names(dat) <- c("location", "total", "owner", "renter")
#head(dat)


flextable(dat) %>% 
  add_header_row(values = c("Location", "% of households spending 30% or more of income on shelter cost"),
                  colwidths = c(1, 3)) %>%
  set_header_labels(location = "Location", 
                    total = "Total households", 
                    owner = "Owner households", 
                    renter = "Renter households") %>%
  merge_v(part = "header") %>%
  width(width = c(1.5, 1.6, 1.6, 1.6)) %>%
  set_caption(caption = "Percent of households spending 30% or more of income on shelter cost in primary downtowns by tenure, 2021") %>%
  add_footer_lines("Source: Statistics Canada")
