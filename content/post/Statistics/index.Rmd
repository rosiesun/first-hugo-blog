# Unsustainable Cost

In 2021, a staggering 45% of Toronto renter households spent more than 30% of their income on housing. (See Table \@ref(tab:T1).)

```{r T1, results='asis'}

# Table \@ref(tab:T1)

dat <- read.csv("~/housing data/housingcost_over30percent.csv")
names(dat) <- c("location", "total", "owner", "renter")
#head(dat)

knitr::kable(dat, 
      col.names = c("Location", "Total households", "Owner households", "Renter households"), 
      caption = "Percent of households spending 30% or more of income on shelter cost in primary downtowns by tenure, 2021 (Source: Statistics Canada)")
